- 👋 Hi, I’m @luis-cedillo
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Full Stack Web Development. I would love to be able to implement a Netflix application clone. That's the goal!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript. I'm polishing my HTML and CSS skills. However, more specifically, I'm focusing on Algorithms and Data Structures.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects and applications to enhance my technical and leadership skills.
- 📫 You can reach me @ luis.m.cedillo@gmail.com or @realLuisCedillo on Twitter
